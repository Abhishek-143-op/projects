                    <p class=" para">Penguins are often seen as symbols of resilience, surviving in some of the harshest environments on Earth. However, recent observations have shown unusual behavior in some penguins, where individuals leave their colonies and move toward remote or inland areas. Scientists believe this may be linked to environmental stress rather than intentional self-harm.</p>
